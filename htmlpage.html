            <div class=content><h3>Intro to HTML and CSS</h3><p>Html, standing for "Hypertext Markup Language", is the language in which almost every single webpage is written in. HTML is like the skeleton of all webpages, giving the structure and content of webpages, letting other languages like CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) decorate the skeleton like a Christmas tree. Html uses different "tags" and "attributes" to custom design websites, as well as format them efficiently. CSS is like the skin to the  bones, and adds some style and color to your website. You can change the font-style, background color, and even animations with CSS. Another helpful thing with CSS is you can link multiple HTML files to your one CSS stylesheet, saving you the hassle of making a new one.</p></div>
            <div class=content><h3>Tags</h3>A tag in HTML is an indicator to tell the web browswer to execute something in a certain way. In HTML, a tag is just a set of instructions, telling the browser what to do with the text in between the tags, depending on what the tags specify the browser to do. We also have these things in html called Attributes. Attributes are really helpful for giving specific pieces of text certain, well, attributes to style your website more. But they also add more options to your basic tags, for example, you can give your paragraph tag a title witht the title attribute, this is helpful for adding more purposes for your tags and certain parts of your website.
