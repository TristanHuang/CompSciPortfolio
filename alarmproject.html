                       For one of my projects, I chose to make an alarm clock with HTML and Javascript. This alarm clock would tell the time in a web browser and you would be able to set an alarm for a certain time and it would beep at that time like a regular alarm clock. It was also supposed to change the background of the page to different colors or backgrounds according to what time of day it was, but I didn't finish doing that.
