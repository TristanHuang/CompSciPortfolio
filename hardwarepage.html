              All the amazing stuff we can do with computers, all start out with the hardware of the computer, and determines the performance of the computer. In a computer, there are many different pieces that allowed it to run. The motherboard in a computer is what holds everything together, it relays the information and electricity from one piece to another in the computer.

             <ol>
                <li>Motherboard</li>
                    <ul><li>All of the componenents of the computer are attached to the motherboard, allowing more efficient and organized information relaying in the computer between each of the computer units.
                    </li></ul>
                <li>CPU</li>
                    <ul><li>The CPU (Computer Processing Unit) is the essential brain of the computer, which is usually connected to the motherboard directly. The CPU, also known as the processor, does all of the math and computing for the computer, what it essentially does is it translates all of the coding that humans write for it, and translates it into a language that computer understands and executes the code.
                    </li></ul>
                <li>Graphics Card</li>
                    <ul><li>
                    The GPU(Graphics Processing Unit), or the graphics card, is the thing on the computer that translates all of the computer code into an image on your screen.
                    </li></ul>
                <li>Hardrive</li>
                    <ul><li>
                    Then you have your hardrive, which remembers all of the long term memory of your computer, for instance your family album, or a text document.
                    </li></ul>
                <li>RAM</li>
                    <ul><li>
                    But what if your computer needs to remember something and return to the information really quickly without having to navigate through your hardrive? That's what RAM(Random Access Memory) is for. It's kind of like the short-term memory of your computer when your hardrive is the long-term memory. RAM is just basically memory that can be saved and accessed really fast, and when its all taken up, your computer gets really slow, but all the RAM is then erased once you shut-down your computer.
                    </li></ul>
                <li>Power Supply</li>
                    <ul><li>
                    But with all these different computer components, you would think you would need a lot of electricity, and thats why we created a power supply. A power supply is basically a component that supplies all of the electricity needed to run everything efficiently. The power supply divides the electricity from an outlet in the wall to all of the components, depending on how much electricity each individual components need.
                    </li></ul>
                <li>Monitors, Keyboards, and Mice</li>
                    <ul><li>
                    But in order to efficiently send information to the computer from your brain, we have things called monitors, keyboards, and mice. All three of these things are connected back to the motherboard, where the motherboard tells the other components what to do. The monitor of a computer is your actual screen, which displays the information of the computer to your eyes. A keyboard is what you type on, or what sends the computer information that makes sense to us, and that the computer can translate into its own language.
